Mobile Web Cams
===

Living in central belt Scotland, the weather can be quite changable but also weather reports are frequently inaccurate.  The best way to check the weather is to look out of the window, but this can be pretty tricky when out and about.  What my wife needed was a way to see the weather at home while she was out and the obvious way to do that is with a web-cam.

As a mobile developer I have a number of old devices lying around the place going unused.  It seemed obvious to me that these could be repurposed as web-cams instead of buying one, so the primary goal of this project is to create a web-cam from an old Android phone using IBMBluemix to store the data and a Vaadin app to retrieve the web-cam data and display it.

* Create an Android app which uploads an image with a location to IBMBluemix
* Create a Vaadin app which shows the locations of uploaded images on a map and allow users to see that image
